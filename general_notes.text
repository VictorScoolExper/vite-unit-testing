What to Test?
Only test what you can manipulate, this means dont test apis, browser api, third party api, etc.

Rules to write good tests:
AAA
Arange - Act - Assert

Only TEST ONE THING.
    - One Feature or One behavior.
    - Multiple tests instead of one big one.

Focuse on the ESSENCE of a test when arranging.

Keep your number of assertions("expects") LOW.
